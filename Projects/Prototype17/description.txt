Prototype 17 - Rust
---
As I wind down for the Christmas break - i just wanted to update an old texture for the Prototype 17 Pistol in Rust (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQz0yz). Nothing official just general practice.
Oh i made an app to help with hardsurface work like this for production - feel free to download for free! https://pilgrimsart.gumroad.com/l/hardsurfacecheck
Hope everyone has a great Christmas break!
